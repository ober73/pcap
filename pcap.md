Modules

import math
            {} math
            
            
python imports in the math namespace

you can import into your namespace pieces of the module to yours

from math import pi

pring(pi)

to import all do 

form math import *

not reccomended 

you can import as alias which will help avoid name conflicts

DIR function

print(dir(math))

random()


seed

randint returns int not float


randrange


Some useful math functions are the following:


       ceil(x) => rounds the number x up to the nearest integer


       floor(x) => rounds the number x down to the nearest integer


       trunc(x) => the value of x truncated to an integer


       pow(x, y, z) => returns the value of (x ** y) % z. z is optional


       hypot(x1, x2, x3, ..,xn) => calculates the Euclidean form. For n-dimensional cases, the coordinates passed are assumed to be like (x1, x2, x3, …, xn). It is calculated by sqrt(x1*x1 + x2*x2 +x3*x3 …. xn*xn).


       factorial(x) => returns the factorial of a number, it only accepts positive integers. The factorial of a number is the sum of the multiplication, of all the whole numbers, from our specified number down to 1. E.x the factorial of 4 would be 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24
